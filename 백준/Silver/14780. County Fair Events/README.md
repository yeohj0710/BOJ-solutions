### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John has returned to the County Fair so he can attend the special events (concerts, rodeos, cooking shows, etc.). He wants to attend as many of the N (1 <= N <= 10,000) special events as he possibly can.</p>

<p>He's rented a bicycle so he can speed from one event to the next in absolutely no time at all (0 time units to go from one event to the next!).</p>

<p>Given a list of the events that FJ might wish to attend, with their start times (1 <= T <= 100,000) and their durations (1 <= L <= 100,000), determine the maximum number of events that FJ can attend. FJ never leaves an event early.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer, N.</li>
	<li>Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers, T and L, that describe an event that FJ might attend.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer that is the maximum number of events FJ can attend.</li>
</ul>
