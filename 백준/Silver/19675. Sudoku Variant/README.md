<p>Similar to Sudoku, the 3x3 grid you are given is already partially filled with the digits 1 through 9.

<p>In the given grid there are at least 1 empty grid position and at most 3 empty grid positions, you may assume that the partially filled grid is consistent with the rules, i.e. no number is duplicated on any row or column. You are required to determine the number of ways the empty positions can be filled.</p>
