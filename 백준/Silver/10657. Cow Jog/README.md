### 문제 설명

<p>The cows are out exercising their hooves again!  There are N cows jogging on an infinitely-long single-lane track (1 <= N <= 100,000). Each cow starts at a distinct position on the track, and some cows jog at different speeds.</p>

<p>With only one lane in the track, cows cannot pass each other.  When a faster cow catches up to another cow, she has to slow down to avoid running into the other cow, becoming part of the same running group.</p>

<p>Eventually, no more cows will run into each other.  Farmer John wonders how many groups will be left when this happens.  Please help him compute this number.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integer N.</p>

<p>The following N lines each contain the initial position and speed of a single cow.  Position is a nonnegative integer and speed is a positive integer; both numbers are at most 1 billion.  All cows start at  distinct positions, and these will be given in increasing order in the input.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>A single integer indicating how many groups remain.</p>

<p> </p>
