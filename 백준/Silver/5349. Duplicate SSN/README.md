### 문제 설명

<p>The U.S. Social Security Administration has made a terrible mistake. When assigning new Social Security numbers (SSN) to U.S. citizens they accidently assigned some duplicate numbers. Fortunately, they caught this mistake early and have a list all the possible duplicates. The Social Security Administration must contact all the people that do not have a unique SSN. Your job is to read the list of Social Security numbers and find all the duplicates. You will then print the list of duplicates in ascending order.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input is a list of Social Security numbers, one per line. Input will be terminated with the Social Security number 000-00-0000, which is not a duplicate.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>A list of all Social Security numbers, in ascending order, that appear more than once as input.</p>
