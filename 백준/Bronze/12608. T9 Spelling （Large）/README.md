### 문제 설명

<p>The Latin alphabet contains 26 characters and telephones only have ten digits on the keypad. We would like to make it easier to write a message to your friend using a sequence of keypresses to indicate the desired characters. The letters are mapped onto the digits as shown below. To insert the character <code>B</code> for instance, the program would press <code>22</code>. In order to insert two characters in sequence from the same key, the user must pause before pressing the key a second time. The space character <code>' '</code> should be printed to indicate a pause. For example, <code>2 2</code> indicates <code>AA</code> whereas <code>22</code> indicates <code>B</code>.</p>
