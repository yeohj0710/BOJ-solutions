### 문제 설명

<p>Magnus lost a game of chess to Kile so he found comfort in competitive programming. Very soon, he heard of the iconic COCI competition and decided to try his luck there.</p>

<p>He wrote a mail to Kile: “Dear Kile, please, prepare me for COCI. Magnus”.</p>

<p>Kile replied: “You want to participate in COCI? All right, here's your warm-up task. A series of four consecutive letters of some word that make up the subword “HONI” (Croatian acronym for COCI) is called the HONI-block. I will send you the word of length N and you will throw out as many letters as you want (it might be none as well) so that in the end there are as many HONI-blocks as possible in the word. Kile”.</p>

<p>Magnus was very worried and asked you, COCI competitive scene, for help. Help him determine the maximum number of HONI-blocks he can get in the final word.</p>

### 출력
