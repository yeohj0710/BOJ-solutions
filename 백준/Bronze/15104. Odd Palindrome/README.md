### 문제 설명

<p>We say that a string is odd if and only if all palindromic substrings of the string have odd length.</p>

<p>Given a string s, determine if it is odd or not.</p>

<p>A substring of a string s is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters from s. A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same forwards and backwards.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line containing the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100).</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that s consists of lowercase ASCII letters (‘a’–‘z’) only</p>

### 출력 

 <p>If s is odd, then print “Odd.” on a single line (without quotation marks). Otherwise, print “Or not.” on a single line (without quotation marks).</p>
