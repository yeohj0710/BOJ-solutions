<p>Define the complexity of a string to be the number of distinct letters in it. For example, the string <code>string</code> has complexity 6 and the string <code>letter</code> has complexity 4.</p>

<p>You like strings which have complexity either 1 or 2. Your friend has given you a string and you want to turn it into a string that you like. You have a magic eraser which will delete one letter from any string. Compute the minimum number of times you will need to use the eraser to turn the string into a string with complexity at most 2.</p>
